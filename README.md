Revised Implementation Plan
1. Preprocessing Strategy
Image Resizing Approach:

Given the professor's emphasis on evaluation in the original domain, we should design our pipeline with this in mind.
The average image size is 435.9 × 390.0, so a 512×512 target size seems reasonable without excessive upscaling.
To preserve aspect ratios and avoid distortion of important features:

Resize the shorter dimension to the target size
Then center crop to create a square image
This approach preserves the central subject (usually the pet) while standardizing dimensions



Handling Corrupt Images:

Identify and remove corrupt images and their corresponding masks as requested

Train/Val Split:

Perform a stratified 80/20 split ensuring similar class distribution between train and validation
Ensure proper representation of both cat and dog classes

2. Augmentation Pipeline
Class-Specific Augmentation:

Create two separate augmentation pipelines - one for cat images and one for dog images
Apply more aggressive augmentations to cat images to address the class imbalance

Spatial Augmentations:

Horizontal flips only (avoid vertical flips for animals)
Small rotations (±15°)
Scale variations (0.8-1.2)
Be cautious with augmentations that might affect borders - avoid padding that could confuse the "don't care" regions

Pixel-level Augmentations:

Brightness/contrast adjustments
Color jitter (hue, saturation)
Slight blur/sharpening
Gaussian noise

Augmentation Intensity:

More aggressive for cats (higher probability and intensity of transformations)
More conservative for dogs

Augmentation Workflow:

Generate multiple augmented versions of each original image
Save all augmented data to disk (not on-the-fly)
Generate more augmentations for cats than dogs (e.g., 4 augmentations per cat image, 2 per dog image)

Augmentation Setup:

Use Albumentations with PyTorch compatibility
Create configuration files for cat and dog augmentation pipelines
Document all augmentation parameters for reproducibility

Validation Set:

No augmentation for validation set, just preprocessing (resize + center crop)

4. Quality Assurance
Data Verification:

Visual inspection of augmented samples
Verify class distribution after augmentation
Check for any artifacts or distortions

Documentation:

Document all preprocessing steps and parameters
Create visualizations of original vs. augmented images
Provide detailed instructions for using the augmented dataset

Questions for Further Discussion

Exact Resize Dimensions: Should we go with 512×512 or consider a smaller size like 384×384 given the average image dimensions?
Augmentation Ratios: What's the optimal number of augmentations per image for cats vs. dogs to balance the classes?
Mask Handling: Do we need any special considerations for handling the class 255 (don't care region) during augmentation?
CutMix/MixUp: Do you think these advanced augmentations would be appropriate for this segmentation task, or should we stick with more traditional augmentations?
Elastic Deformations: How aggressive should we be with elastic transforms? They can help with segmentation tasks but might distort animal features.
